Git - version control system
If u change ur code at different times it saves a copy of all the versions
Github - cloud version of git
repository - directory or a folder 
git init - creates the file to be a part of git
git status - gives the status and recent changes 
git add nameoffile makes git track the file 
git commit takes a snapshot of the file at the moment , -m is a comment that 
gives you a message to the snapshot: like a comment or a caption to the photo
this lets u know what u did at that moment 

git doesnt allow you to make annonymous changes so u should register with an email id 
for that use git config user.email
after that u can use commit

git log : keeps track of all the commit messages
each commit has an unique checksum

On Branch Master: main file to which eachh other file changes will be linked 
when u create a branch : you create another version of ur code 
that u can continue working on it.

git branch name : creates a new branch
git checkout name: takes u to that folder

Now lets start working on dev branch
